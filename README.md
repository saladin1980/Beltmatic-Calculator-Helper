Beltmatic is a casual factory game where you combine numbers using mathematical operations.

This is a program based on the GO project that is located here:
https://go.dev/play/p/BXAENbVxseb

I do not recall where or when I found it, but it is basically same with some added bonus's for the ability to select things a bit easier to use.

It is NOT perfect and far from it but it is open to those whom wish to even take a look as it may help you in your next project and play the game.

Keep in mind that I am in NO means able to reproduce the maths that are taking place as I am not a Math person but learning on how it is working.

Enter in the target number you wish to get, then enter in the numbers you have access too, and check the boxs on what operations are open. 
Once completed then click the button and you will get the best calculations to do in game and order.
